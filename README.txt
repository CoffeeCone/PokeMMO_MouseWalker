------------------------
PokeMMO MouseWalker v1.0
------------------------

How to use:
1. Place "MouseWalker.exe" and "mousewalker.ini" into your PokeMMO folder along with PokeMMO.exe
2. Edit "mousewalker.ini" to match the key binding you have set in-game.
3. While PokeMMO is running, open up "MouseWalker.exe".
4. You can now use your mouse's middle button (scroller) for moving your character. Simply hold it down to the direction you want to go to.
5. Report bugs to me via PM on the forums.

Cheers~

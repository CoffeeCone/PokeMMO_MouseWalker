1. CHANGELOG
------------
See http://coffeecone.com/mousewalker for the latest changelog.


2. BASIC USAGE (WITH DEFAULT INI FILE)
--------------------------------------
1. Place "MouseWalker.exe" and "mousewalker.ini" into your PokeMMO folder along with PokeMMO.exe
2. Edit "mousewalker.ini" to match the key binding you have set in-game.
3. While PokeMMO is running, open up "MouseWalker.exe".
4. You can now use your mouse's middle button (scroller) for moving your character. Simply hold it down to the direction you want to go to.


3. ADDITIONAL OPTIONS
---------------------
VERSION - If you have downloaded a new version,
you should edit this to the new one you
downloaded. That is, if you want to use this
same INI file on it too.

CHECK_UPDATES - Set to true if you want to be
notified of new versions. If not, set to false.

LAUNCHER_MODE - If true, this will serve as a
launcher for PokeMMO. If false, PokeMMO needs
to already be running before you open
MouseWalker.

CONFIRM_MESSAGE - When set to true, it will give
you a alert box that it has successfully
detected PokeMMO and is ready to use. The alert
box will auto close in 10 seconds. If set to
false, you will not get any alert boxes.
(The alert box will also not be displayed if
LAUNCHER_MODE is true.)

MINIMUM_MEMORY - The minimum memory you want to
allot to the game. Normally this can be the
following: 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048.

MAXIMUM_MEMORY - The maximum memory you want to
allot to the game. Normally this can be the
following: 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048.

OFFSET - This is the one in charge for when the
program assumes you to be going left, right, up,
or down. I advise you not change this but you're
free to experiment though. See what value suits
you.

ENABLE_AB - If set to true, the key A and key B
bindings to the left and right mouse clicks will
be enabled. If set to false, it will not be
bound to left and right mouse clicks.


4. BUG REPORTS
--------------
Report bugs to me via me@shedosurashu.com mail.


5. ABOUT
--------------
This was made because I wanted a way to be able
to move my character without having to use the
keyboard. Since the middle-click button wasn't
in bound in-game, I decided to use it instead
so as to not interfere with general gameplay keys.
